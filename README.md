# Coroded_AndNon_Corroded_ImageDetection

Subsea pipelines transport offshore hydrocarbons to onshore facilities, but harsh underwater conditions cause corrosion, posing safety risks, 
financial losses, and environmental harm. This study examines the efficacy of using machine learning and computer vision for detecting corrosion in subsea pipelines. Data that share same characteristics with an Aberdeen-based energy firm's data will be used to create algorithms and compare them to existing methods. The study will provide insights into the potential of these techniques for future corrosion classification research.
